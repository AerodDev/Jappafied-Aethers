Overview:
The Jappafied Aether is a Resource pack that aims to redo the looks of the Aether mod to fit the 1.14+ style, maintained by Aerod and BrianIsBro.
As of now, the pack only takes care of the Aether I textures, while Aether II - Highlands textures are being worked on which you can try by downloading the beta version from the GitHub page.
The pack works as a solid Jappa texture backport, supports Aether b1.7.3 textures which you can access by going into the “optional” folder in the pack and also updates the looks of the Aether Lost Content Mod, which is a very popular Aether addon.
It will get updated to Minecraft 1.16 version when the Aether I port is finished.
